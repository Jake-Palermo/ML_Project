# ML_Project

This final project for my intro to Machine Learning course explores a massive data set taken from the kaggle competition held in November of 2022.

Me and my groupmates used python and the pandas framework to create and evaluate training data using several different graphs and equations to represent such a large dataset.

You will see in our analysis in the project our findings, shortcomings, and considerations for future machine learning applications.
