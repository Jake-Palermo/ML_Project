# ML_Project

Project Summary:

Explored creation and optimization of a machine learning pipeline.

Utilized a large dataset with prediction values for 40,000 unique IDs, along with a ground truth table for the first 20,000 IDs.

Applied lasso regression for feature selection, narrowing down to 14 relevant features.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using correlation heatmap and pairwise plot.

Implemented various algorithms, including logistic regression, gradient-boosting classifier, XG Boost classifier, K-nearest neighbors, and random decision forests.

Employed K-fold cross-validation to validate datasets.

Evaluated models based on accuracy, log loss, and MSE, using confusion matrices and precision-recall curves.
